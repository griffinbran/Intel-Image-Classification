**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Does the student fix data entry issues?
- Are data appropriately labeled?
- Are data appropriately typed?
- Are datasets combined correctly?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?

### Data Visualization

> * Make some pretty plots:

**Visualizations**
- Are the requested visualizations provided?
- Do plots accurately demonstrate valid relationships?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?
